### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.
-   Collect information about the bug:
    -   Stack trace (Traceback)
    -   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    -   Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
    -   Possibly your input and the output
    -   Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
