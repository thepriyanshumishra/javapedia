While working with loops, it is sometimes desirable to skip some statements inside the loop or terminate the loop immediately without checking the test expression.

In such cases, `break` and `continue` statements are used.

The break statement in Java terminates the loop immediately, and the control of the program moves to the next statement following the loop.

## 1. Java break statement

The syntax of the break statement in Java is:

```java
break;
```

### Example 1: Java break statement

```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // for loop
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {

            // if the value of i is 5 the loop terminates
            if (i == 5) {
                break;
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
2
3
4
```

## 2. Labeled break Statement

In Java, we can use the `break` statement to terminate a specific loop in nested loops. This is done by using a label.

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // the for loop is labeled as first
        first:
        for( int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {

            // the for loop is labeled as second
            second:
            for(int j = 1; j < 3; j ++ ) {
                System.out.println("i = " + i + "; j = " +j);

                // the break statement breaks the first for loop
                if ( i == 2)
                    break first;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
i = 1; j = 1
i = 1; j = 2
i = 2; j = 1
```

Here, when `i` is 2, `break first;` is executed, which terminates the outer loop labeled `first`.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Action**: Terminates the loop immediately.
*   **Flow**: Control jumps to the code _after_ the loop.
*   **Labeled Break**: Used to exit nested loops from the inner loop.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Unreachable Code**: Any code written immediately after `break;` in the same block will cause a compile-time error because it can never be reached.
