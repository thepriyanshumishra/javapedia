In computer programming, comments are a portion of the program that are completely ignored by Java compilers. They are mainly used to help programmers to understand the code.

```java
// declare and initialize two variables
int a = 1;
int b = 3;

// print the output
System.out.println("This is output");
```

## Types of Comments in Java

In Java, there are three types of comments:

1.  **Single-line comment**
2.  **Multi-line comment**
3.  **Documentation comment (Javadoc)**

### 1. Single-line Comment

A single-line comment starts and ends in the same line. To write a single-line comment, we can use the `//` symbol.

```java
// "Hello, World!" program example

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // prints "Hello, World!"
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The Java compiler ignores everything from `//` to the end of line.

### 2. Multi-line Comment

When we want to write comments in multiple lines, we can use the multi-line comment. To write multi-line comments, we can use the `/*....*/` symbol.

```java
/* This is an example of  multi-line comment.
 * The program prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.
 */

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### 3. Documentation Comment (Javadoc)

Documentation comments are used to create API documentation. They start with `/**` and end with `*/`.

```java
/**
 * This class represents a Student.
 * @author Javapedia
 * @version 1.0
 */
public class Student {
    /**
     * Calculates the grade based on marks.
     * @param marks The marks obtained by the student.
     * @return The grade (A, B, C, etc.)
     */
    public char calculateGrade(int marks) {
        // logic
        return 'A';
    }
}
```

**Tip 💡:** Javadoc comments are super powerful! Tools can read them and automatically generate professional HTML documentation for your code.

## Use Comments the Right Way

One thing you should always consider that comments shouldn't be the substitute for a way to explain poorly written code in English. You should always write well structured and self explaining code. And, then use comments.

**Bad Comment:**
```java
// This variable stores the age
int a = 10;
```

**Good Code (No comment needed):**
```java
int age = 10;
```

**Good Comment:**
```java
// We use a binary search here because the list is already sorted
// and performance is critical for this large dataset.
int index = binarySearch(list, target);
```

<Callout>

**Note:** In most cases, always use comments to explain **'why'** rather than **'how'** and you are good to go.

</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

*   **Single-line**: Starts with `//`. Everything after is ignored.
*   **Multi-line**: Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. Can span multiple lines.
*   **Javadoc**: Starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`. Used for generating API documentation.
*   **Purpose**: Use comments to explain _why_ you did something, not _what_ the code is doing (unless it's complex).

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Over-commenting**: Don't comment obvious things like `int a = 5; // declaring integer a`. It clutters the code.

> [!WARNING]
> **Nesting**: You cannot nest multi-line comments inside other multi-line comments. `/* /* */ */` will cause an error.
