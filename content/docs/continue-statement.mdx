description: In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Java continue statement to skip the current iteration of a loop.

While working with loops, sometimes you might want to skip some statements or terminate the loop. In such cases, break and continue statements are used.

To learn about the break statement, visit Java break. Here, we will learn about the continue statement.

Here, `continue` is a keyword. It skips the current iteration of the loop. (for, while, do...while, etc).

After the continue statement, the program moves to the end of the loop. And, test expression is evaluated (update statement is evaluated in case of the for loop).

Here's the syntax of the continue statement.

```java
continue;
```

Note: The continue statement is almost always used in decision-making statements (if...else Statement).

## Working of Java continue statement

The working of continue statement with Java while, do...while, and for loop.
Working of Java continue Statement

### Example 1: Java continue statement

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {

      // if value of i is between 4 and 9
      // continue is executed
      if (i > 4 && i < 9) {
        continue;
      }
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
1
2
3
4
9
10
```

In the above program, we are using the for loop to print the value of i in each iteration. To know how for loop works, visit Java for loop. Notice the statement,

```java
if (i > 4 && i < 9) {
    continue;
}
```

Here, the continue statement is executed when the value of i becomes more than 4 and less than 9.

It then skips the print statement for those values. Hence, the output skips the values 5, 6, 7, and 8.

### Example 2: Compute the sum of 5 positive numbers

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Double number, sum = 0.0;
    // create an object of Scanner
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    for (int i = 1; i < 6; ++i) {
      System.out.print("Enter number " + i + " : ");
      // takes input from the user
      number = input.nextDouble();

      // if number is negative
      // continue statement is executed
      if (number <= 0.0) {
        continue;
      }

      sum += number;
    }
    System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
    input.close();
  }
}
```

#### Output:

```plaintext
Enter number 1: 2.2
Enter number 2: 5.6
Enter number 3: 0
Enter number 4: -2.4
Enter number 5: -3
Sum = 7.8
```

In the above example, we have used the for loop to print the sum of 5 positive numbers. Notice the line,

```java
if (number < 0.0) {
    continue;
}
```

Here, when the user enters a negative number, the continue statement is executed. This skips the current iteration of the loop and takes the program control to the update expression of the loop.

Note: To take input from the user, we have used the Scanner object. To learn more, visit Java Scanner.

<Quiz
  question="What happens to the code after the 'continue' statement in the current iteration?"
  options={[
    "It is executed",
    "It is skipped",
    "It causes an error",
    "It is printed",

**Tip 💡:** `continue` says "I'm done with this round, let's start the next one!" It's perfect for skipping over bad data or specific cases.

  question="Use continue to skip printing 3 in a loop from 1 to 5."
  expectedOutput="1\n2\n4\n5"
  hint="Use 'if (i == 3) continue;' to skip the iteration."

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

## Key Takeaways

- **Action**: Skips the rest of the _current_ iteration.
- **Flow**: Jumps to the next iteration (update step in `for`, condition in `while`).
- **Usage**: Great for filtering out invalid data (e.g., skip negative numbers).

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Infinite While Loop**: In a `while` loop, if you `continue` _before_ incrementing your counter (e.g., `i++`), the loop will get stuck on the same value forever!
