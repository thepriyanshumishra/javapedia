# Debugging Techniques

Debugging is the art of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program.

## Common Debugging Strategies

1.  **Print Debugging**: Using `System.out.println` to trace the flow and variable values. Simple but can clutter code.
2.  **Using a Debugger**: Modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse have powerful built-in debuggers.
    - **Breakpoints**: Pause execution at a specific line.
    - **Step Over**: Execute the current line and move to the next.
    - **Step Into**: Go inside the method call at the current line.
    - **Watch Variables**: Monitor the values of specific variables in real-time.

## Advanced Debugging

### Conditional Breakpoints

You can set a breakpoint to trigger ONLY when a specific condition is met (e.g., `i == 500`). This is huge for debugging loops!

### Remote Debugging

Allows you to debug a Java application running on a different server. You connect your IDE to the remote process using a specific port.

## Reading Stack Traces

A stack trace shows the call stack at the moment an exception occurred. It is your best friend when debugging crashes.

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at com.example.MyApp.processData(MyApp.java:15)
    at com.example.MyApp.main(MyApp.java:5)
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip 💡">
  Always read the stack trace from the top down. The first line tells you *what*
  happened, and the following lines tell you *where*.
