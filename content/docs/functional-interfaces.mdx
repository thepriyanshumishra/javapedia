# Functional Interfaces

A **Functional Interface** is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. They can have any number of default or static methods. Functional interfaces are the basis for Lambda Expressions in Java.

## The `@FunctionalInterface` Annotation

While not mandatory, it is best practice to use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. This ensures the compiler checks that the interface has only one abstract method.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
}
```

## Built-in Functional Interfaces

Java 8 introduced the `java.util.function` package containing common functional interfaces:

1.  **`Predicate<T>`**: Takes an argument and returns a boolean.
2.  **`Consumer<T>`**: Takes an argument and returns nothing (void).
3.  **`Function<T, R>`**: Takes an argument of type T and returns a result of type R.
4.  **`Supplier<T>`**: Takes no arguments and returns a result of type T.

  You don't always need to create your own functional interfaces. Check
  `java.util.function` first!
