# Version Control with Git

Git is the standard for version control. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert mistakes.

## Basic Commands

### `git init`

Initializes a new Git repository.

### `git clone <url>`

Copies an existing repository from a remote server (like GitHub).

### `git add <file>`

Stages changes to be committed. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.

### `git commit -m "message"`

Saves the staged changes with a descriptive message.

### `git push`

Uploads your local commits to the remote repository.

### `git pull`

Downloads changes from the remote repository to your local machine.

## .gitignore for Java

You should not commit compiled code (`.class` files) or build artifacts. Create a `.gitignore` file:

```bash
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml

<Callout type="info" title="Tip 💡">
  Commit often and write clear, descriptive commit messages. It helps you (and
  others) understand the history of your project.
