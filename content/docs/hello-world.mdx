A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie.

Let's explore how Java "Hello, World!" program works.

## Java "Hello, World!" Program

```java title="HelloWorld.java"
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
Hello, World!
```

<div className="p-4 bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900 rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800 my-6">

## How Java "Hello, World!" Program Works?

### 1. Your First Program

In Java, any line starting with `//` is a comment. Comments are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent and functionality of the program. It is completely ignored by the Java compiler.

### 2. class HelloWorld

In Java, every application begins with a class definition. In the program, `HelloWorld` is the name of the class, and the class definition is:

```java
class HelloWorld {
 ... .. ...
}
```

**Rule**: The name of the public class must match the filename. If the class is `public class HelloWorld`, the file **must** be named `HelloWorld.java`.

### 3. public static void main(String[] args)

This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.

*   **public**: Access modifier. It means the method is visible to everyone.
*   **static**: It means the method belongs to the class, not an instance of the class.
*   **void**: It means the method does not return any value.
*   **main**: The name of the method.
*   **String[] args**: An array of Strings. It stores command-line arguments passed to the program.

### 4. System.out.println("Hello, World!");

The code above is a print statement. It prints the text `Hello, World!` to standard output (your screen).

*   **System**: A built-in class that contains useful members.
*   **out**: A static member of the System class (Standard Output Stream).
*   **println**: Method to print a line.

**Tip 💡:** `public static void main` is a bit of a mouthful! Just memorize it for now. It's the magic spell that starts every Java program.

## Command Line Arguments

The `String[] args` parameter in the main method allows you to pass arguments from the command line.

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Argument 1: " + args[0]);
  }
}
```

If you run this with `java Main Hello`, it will print `Argument 1: Hello`.

## Challenge

<Challenge
  id="hello-world"
  nextChapterId="variables-and-literals"
  question="Modify the program to print 'Hello Javapedia'."
  expectedOutput="Hello Javapedia"
  hint="Change the text inside the quotes."
  solution={`public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Javapedia");
    }
}`}
  defaultCode={`public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}`}
/>

## Key Takeaways

*   **Class Definition**: Every Java program must have at least one class.
*   **Main Method**: `public static void main(String[] args)` is the entry point.
*   **Printing**: `System.out.println()` prints to the console.
*   **Case Sensitive**: Java is case-sensitive.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Case Sensitivity**: Java is case-sensitive. `Main` is different from `main`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Missing Semicolons**: Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon `;`.
