title: Java if...else Statement
description: In this tutorial, you will learn about control flow statements using Java if and if...else statements with the help of examples.

In programming, we use the `if..else` statement to run a block of code among more than one alternatives.

For example, assigning grades (A, B, C) based on the percentage obtained by a student.

*   if the percentage is above **90**, assign grade **A**
*   if the percentage is above **75**, assign grade **B**
*   if the percentage is above **65**, assign grade **C**

## 1. Java if (if-then) Statement

The syntax of an **if-then** statement is:

```java
if (condition) {
  // statements
}
```

Here, `condition` is a boolean expression such as `age >= 18`.

*   if `condition` evaluates to `true` , statements are executed
*   if `condition` evaluates to `false` , statements are skipped

### Example 1: Java if Statement

```java
class IfStatement {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int number = 10;

    // checks if number is less than 0
    if (number < 0) {
      System.out.println("The number is negative.");
    }

    System.out.println("Statement outside if block");
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Statement outside if block
```

## 2. Java if...else (if-then-else) Statement

The `if` statement executes a certain section of code if the test expression is evaluated to `true`. However, if the test expression is evaluated to `false`, it does nothing.

In this case, we can use an optional `else` block. Statements inside the body of `else` block are executed if the test expression is evaluated to `false`.

```java
if (condition) {
  // codes in if block
}
else {
  // codes in else block
}
```

### Example 2: Java if...else Statement

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 10;

    // checks if number is greater than 0
    if (number > 0) {
      System.out.println("The number is positive.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
    }

    System.out.println("Statement outside if...else block");
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
The number is positive.
Statement outside if...else block
```

## 3. Java if...else...if Statement

In Java, we have an if...else...if ladder, that can be used to execute one block of code among multiple other blocks.

```java
if (condition1) {
  // codes
}
else if(condition2) {
  // codes
}
else if (condition3) {
  // codes
}
else {
  // codes
}
```

### Example 3: Java if...else...if Statement

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int number = 0;

    // checks if number is greater than 0
    if (number > 0) {
      System.out.println("The number is positive.");
    }
    // checks if number is less than 0
    else if (number < 0) {
      System.out.println("The number is negative.");
    }
    // if both condition is false
    else {
      System.out.println("The number is 0.");
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Java Nested if..else Statement

In Java, it is also possible to use `if..else` statements inside an `if...else` statement. It's called the nested `if...else` statement.

```java
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // code
    }
}
```

## 5. Ternary Operator (Shorthand if...else)

There is also a shorthand called the **ternary operator**, which is known as the `? :` operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

```java
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
```

**Example:**

```java
int time = 20;
String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
System.out.println(result);
```

## Key Takeaways

*   **if**: Executes code only if the condition is `true`.
*   **else**: Executes code if the `if` condition is `false`.
*   **else if**: Checks a new condition if the previous one was false.
*   **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for `if...else`.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Assignment vs Comparison**: `if (a = 5)` assigns 5 to `a`. `if (a == 5)` checks if `a` equals 5.

> [!WARNING]
> **Missing Braces**: While single-line `if` statements work without `{ }`, it's safer to always use them to avoid bugs when adding more lines later.
