To start programming in Java, you need to install the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**. The JDK contains the tools you need to build and run Java programs.

---

## 1. Check if Java is already installed

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
java -version
```

If you see a version number (e.g., `java version "17.0.1"`), Java is already installed! If not, follow the steps below.

## 2. Install JDK

We recommend installing the **Oracle JDK** or **OpenJDK**.

### Windows

1.  **Download**: Go to the [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) page.
2.  **Installer**: Download the **x64 Installer** (`.exe` file).
3.  **Run**: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard.
4.  **Environment Variable**:
    *   Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows Search.
    *   Click "Edit the system environment variables".
    *   Click "Environment Variables".
    *   Under "System variables", click "New".
    *   Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
    *   Variable value: Path to your JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).
    *   Find the `Path` variable, click "Edit", and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`.

### macOS

1.  **Download**: Go to the [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) page.
2.  **Installer**: Download the **x64 DMG Installer** (or **Arm 64 DMG Installer** for M1/M2/M3 chips).
3.  **Run**: Open the `.dmg` file and follow the instructions.
4.  **Verify**: Open a new terminal and run `java -version`.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
```

## 3. Choose a Code Editor (IDE)

While you can write Java code in Notepad, an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** makes life much easier with features like code completion, debugging, and error highlighting.

| IDE | Best For | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IntelliJ IDEA** | Professionals & Beginners | Free (Community) / Paid (Ultimate) |
| **Eclipse** | Enterprise Development | Free (Open Source) |
| **VS Code** | Lightweight Development | Free |
| **BlueJ** | Learning / Education | Free |

<Callout>

**Recommendation 💡:** We highly recommend **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** for beginners. It's powerful, free, and industry-standard.

</Callout>

## 4. Verify Installation

Let's make sure everything is set up correctly.

1.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
2.  Type `javac -version` and press Enter.
    *   If you see something like `javac 17.0.1`, the **compiler** is ready.
3.  Type `java -version` and press Enter.
    *   If you see the version, the **runtime** is ready.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **JRE vs JDK**: Installing just the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) allows you to *run* Java programs but not *write* them. You must install the **JDK** to develop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Path Issues**: If `javac` is not recognized, it usually means your `JAVA_HOME` or `Path` environment variable is not set correctly.

## What's Next?

Now that your environment is ready, let's learn about the core components of Java.
