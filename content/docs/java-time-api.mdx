# Java Time API

Prior to Java 8, date and time handling in Java was complex and error-prone. The new `java.time` package (JSR-310) provides a comprehensive and immutable API for date and time.

## Key Classes

- **`LocalDate`**: Represents a date without time (e.g., `2023-10-05`).
- **`LocalTime`**: Represents a time without date (e.g., `14:30:00`).
- **`LocalDateTime`**: Represents both date and time (e.g., `2023-10-05T14:30:00`).
- **`ZonedDateTime`**: Represents a date and time with a time zone.
- **`Period`**: Represents a quantity of time in terms of years, months, and days.
- **`Duration`**: Represents a quantity of time in terms of seconds and nanoseconds.

## Examples

### Getting Current Date and Time

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class TimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();

        System.out.println("Date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Time: " + time);
        System.out.println("DateTime: " + dateTime);
    }
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip 💡">
  The classes in `java.time` are immutable and thread-safe, making them much
  safer to use than the old `java.util.Date`.
