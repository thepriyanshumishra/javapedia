# Apache Maven

Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (Project Object Model). It is used for project builds, dependency management, and documentation.

## Why use Maven?

- **Dependency Management**: Automatically downloads libraries and their dependencies.
- **Standard Project Structure**: Provides a consistent directory structure.
- **Build Lifecycle**: Standardized build process (compile, test, package, deploy).

## The `pom.xml` File

The `pom.xml` file is the core of a Maven project. It contains configuration information about the project and details used by Maven to build it.

```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.12</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```

  Maven repositories like Maven Central host millions of libraries that you can
  easily include in your project.
