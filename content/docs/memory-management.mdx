# Java Memory Management

Understanding how Java manages memory is crucial for writing efficient applications. Java memory is primarily divided into **Stack** and **Heap**.

## Stack vs Heap

| Feature      | Stack Memory                       | Heap Memory                  |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Storage**  | Local variables, method calls      | Objects, instance variables  |
| **Access**   | Fast access                        | Slower access                |
| **Size**     | Small, fixed size                  | Large, dynamic size          |
| **Lifetime** | Cleared when method execution ends | Cleared by Garbage Collector |

## Garbage Collection (GC)

Garbage Collection is the process of automatically identifying and discarding objects that are no longer in use to free up memory resources.

### How it Works

1.  **Mark**: The GC identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not.
2.  **Sweep**: The GC removes objects identified during the "mark" phase.
3.  **Compact**: (Optional) Memory is compacted to prevent fragmentation.

  You can request garbage collection using `System.gc()`, but it is not
  guaranteed to run immediately.
