**Multithreading** allows your program to do multiple things at the same time.

Think of it like a **Kitchen** 🍳.

- **Single-threaded**: One chef doing everything. Chop onions -> Boil water -> Cook pasta. (Slow)
- **Multi-threaded**: Three chefs working together. Chef A chops, Chef B boils, Chef C cooks. (Fast!)

## Creating a Thread

There are two ways to create a thread in Java.

### 1. Extend the Thread Class

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyThread thread = new MyThread();
    thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
}
```

### 2. Implement the Runnable Interface

This is the preferred way because you can still extend another class.

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
    Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
}
```

## Concurrency Problems

When multiple threads access the same variable at the same time, problems can occur (Race Conditions).

Imagine two people trying to write in the same notebook at the same time. 📝💥
To fix this, we use **Synchronization** (taking turns).

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}
```

**Tip 💡:** Always use `start()` to run a thread. If you call `run()`, it will execute like a normal method on the _current_ thread, not a new one!

**Note :** Java is a statically-typed language. This means that all variables must be declared before they can be used.

## Key Takeaways

- **Concurrency**: Doing multiple things at the same time.
- **Runnable**: The preferred way to create threads (allows extending other classes).
- **Synchronization**: Prevents threads from interfering with each other.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Race Conditions**: When two threads try to change shared data at the same time, the result is unpredictable. Use `synchronized` to fix this.
>
> **Deadlocks**: When Thread A waits for Thread B, and Thread B waits for Thread A. They wait forever!
