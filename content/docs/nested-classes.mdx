In Java, it is possible to define a class within another class. These are called **Nested Classes**.

The scope of a nested class is bounded by the scope of its enclosing class.

**Syntax:**

```java
class OuterClass {
    // ...
    class NestedClass {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Nested classes are divided into two categories:

1.  **Static Nested Classes**: Nested classes that are declared `static`.
2.  **Inner Classes**: Nested classes that are non-static.

## 1. Static Nested Classes

A static nested class is associated with its outer class. And like static class methods, a static nested class cannot refer directly to instance variables or methods defined in its enclosing class: it can use them only through an object reference.

**Key Points:**
*   Accessed using the enclosing class name: `OuterClass.StaticNestedClass`.
*   Cannot access non-static members of the outer class.

### Example

```java
class OuterClass {
    static int outerStatic = 10;
    int outerInstance = 20;

    static class StaticNestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Outer static: " + outerStatic);
            // System.out.println("Outer instance: " + outerInstance); // Error
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
        nestedObject.display();
    }
}
```

## 2. Inner Classes (Non-Static)

Inner classes are associated with an instance of their enclosing class and have direct access to that object's methods and fields.

**Key Points:**
*   To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class.
*   Can access all members (static and non-static) of the outer class.

### Example

```java
class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;

    class InnerClass {
        public int myInnerMethod() {
            return x;
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass myOuter = new OuterClass();
        OuterClass.InnerClass myInner = myOuter.new InnerClass();
        System.out.println(myInner.myInnerMethod());
    }
}
```

## 3. Local Inner Classes

Local inner classes are classes defined inside a block, which is a group of zero or more statements balanced with braces. You typically find local inner classes defined in the body of a method.

**Key Points:**
*   Scope is restricted to the block where it is defined.
*   Can access final or effectively final local variables.

### Example

```java
public class Main {
    void myMethod() {
        int num = 23;

        class MethodInner_Demo {
            public void print() {
                System.out.println("This is method inner class " + num);
            }
        }

        MethodInner_Demo inner = new MethodInner_Demo();
        inner.print();
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Main outer = new Main();
        outer.myMethod();
    }
}
```

## 4. Anonymous Inner Classes

Anonymous inner classes are inner classes without a name. They are used to instantiate objects with certain "extras" such as method overriding, without having to actually subclass a class.

**Key Points:**
*   Useful when you need to use a class only once.
*   Often used for event handling (listeners).

### Example

```java
abstract class Person {
    abstract void eat();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Person p = new Person() {
            void eat() {
                System.out.println("Nice fruits");
            }
        };
        p.eat();
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

*   **Logical Grouping**: Use nested classes to logically group classes that are only used in one place.
*   **Encapsulation**: Increases encapsulation (inner classes can access private members of outer class).
*   **Readability**: Can lead to more readable and maintainable code if used correctly.
*   **Static vs Non-Static**: Remember that static nested classes behave like top-level classes, while inner classes are tied to an instance.
