Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, `+` is an operator used for addition, while `*` is also an operator used for multiplication.

Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types:

1.  **Arithmetic Operators**
2.  **Assignment Operators**
3.  **Relational Operators**
4.  **Logical Operators**
5.  **Unary Operators**
6.  **Bitwise Operators**

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `+` | Addition | Adds together two values | `x + y` |
| `-` | Subtraction | Subtracts one value from another | `x - y` |
| `*` | Multiplication | Multiplies two values | `x * y` |
| `/` | Division | Divides one value by another | `x / y` |
| `%` | Modulus | Returns the division remainder | `x % y` |

### Example

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 3;
System.out.println(x + y); // 13
System.out.println(x / y); // 3 (Integer division!)
System.out.println(x % y); // 1 (Remainder)
```

## 2. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `=` | `x = 5` | `x = 5` |
| `+=` | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3` |
| `-=` | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` |
| `*=` | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |
| `/=` | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3` |
| `%=` | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` |

---

## 3. Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return a `boolean` result (`true` or `false`).

| Operator | Name | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `==` | Equal to | `x == y` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `x != y` |
| `>` | Greater than | `x > y` |
| `<` | Less than | `x < y` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `x <= y` |

---

## 4. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `&&` | Logical AND | Returns true if both statements are true | `x < 5 && x < 10` |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR | Returns true if one of the statements is true | `x < 5 \|\| x < 4` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true | `!(x < 5 && x < 10)` |

---

## 5. Unary Operators

Unary operators are used with only one operand.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `++` | Increment (increases value by 1) | `++x` or `x++` |
| `--` | Decrement (decreases value by 1) | `--x` or `x--` |

### Prefix vs Postfix

*   **Prefix (`++x`)**: Increments the variable, then uses the new value.
*   **Postfix (`x++`)**: Uses the current value, then increments the variable.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = ++a; // a becomes 6, b becomes 6

int c = 5;
int d = c++; // d becomes 5, c becomes 6
```

---

## 6. Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

| Operator | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `&` | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 |
| `\|` | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
| `^` | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |
| `~` | NOT | Inverts all the bits |
| `<<` | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right |
| `>>` | Signed right shift | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left |

---

## Operator Precedence

Java has well-defined rules for specifying the order in which the operators in an expression are evaluated.

| Category | Operators |
| :--- | :--- |
| Postfix | `expr++` `expr--` |
| Unary | `++expr` `--expr` `+expr` `-expr` `~` `!` |
| Multiplicative | `*` `/` `%` |
| Additive | `+` `-` |
| Shift | `<<` `>>` `>>>` |
| Relational | `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `instanceof` |
| Equality | `==` `!=` |
| Bitwise AND | `&` |
| Bitwise XOR | `^` |
| Bitwise OR | `\|` |
| Logical AND | `&&` |
| Logical OR | `\|\|` |
| Ternary | `? :` |
| Assignment | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` |

## Key Takeaways

*   **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (remainder).
*   **Relational**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (return boolean).
*   **Logical**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
*   **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Equality Check**: Use `==` to compare primitives. NEVER use `==` to compare Strings (use `.equals()` instead).

> [!WARNING]
> **Precedence**: `*` and `/` happen before `+` and `-`. Use parentheses `()` to control the order of operations.
