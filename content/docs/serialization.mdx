# Java Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream, which can be persisted to a file, database, or sent over a network. The reverse process is called deserialization.

## Why Serialization?

- **Persistence**: Save the state of an object to a file.
- **Communication**: Send objects over a network between different JVMs.
- **Deep Copy**: Create an exact copy of an object.

## The `Serializable` Interface

To make a class serializable, it must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. This is a marker interface (it has no methods).

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

class Student implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    int id;
    String name;

    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

  Always declare a `serialVersionUID` to ensure version compatibility during
  deserialization.
