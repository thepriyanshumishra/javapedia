## 1. What is a `static` keyword in Java?

In Java, if we want to access class members, we usually must first create an instance of the class. However, there are situations where we want to access class members without creating an instance.
In those situations, we declare the class members `static`.

```java
// static method
static void myStaticMethod() { ... }
```

<Quiz
  question="Can a static method access non-static variables?"
  options={["Yes", "No", "Only if public", "Only if private"]}
  correctAnswerIndex={1}
/>

Here, `myStaticMethod()` is a static method. It can be called without creating an object of the class.
The `Math` class in Java has almost all of its members static. So, we can access its members without creating instances of the `Math` class.

**Tip 💡:** `static` means "Shared by everyone". Like the office coffee machine. You don't need your own personal coffee machine (object) to get coffee!

</Callout>

### Example 1

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {

        // accessing the methods of the Math class
        System.out.println("Absolute value of -12 =  " + Math.abs(-12));
        System.out.println("Value of PI = " + Math.PI);
        System.out.println("Value of E = " + Math.E);
        System.out.println("2^2 = " + Math.pow(2,2));
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
Absolute value of -12 = 12
Value of PI = 3.141592653589793
Value of E = 2.718281828459045
2^2 = 4.0
```

In the above example, we have not created any instances of the `Math` class. But we are able to access its methods (`abs()` and `pow()`) and variables (`PI` and `E`).

It is possible because the methods and variables of the Math class are static.

<Quiz
  question="If you change the value of a static variable in one object, does it change for all other objects of that class?"
  options={[
    "Yes",
    "No",
    "Only if the variable is public",
    "Only if the variable is final",
  ]}
  correctAnswerIndex={0}
/>

## 2. Static Blocks

Static blocks are used to initialize static variables. They are executed only once when the class is loaded into memory.

```java
class Main {
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;

    // static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
        b = a * 4;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value of a: " + a);
        System.out.println("Value of b: " + b);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Static block initialized.
Value of a: 10
Value of b: 40
```

<Challenge

  nextChapterId="this-keyword"
  question="Create a class 'Counter' with a static variable 'count'. Increment it in the constructor. Create 2 objects and print 'count'."
  expectedOutput="2"
  hint="Use the 'static' keyword for the count variable so it's shared across objects."
  solution={`class Counter {
    static int count = 0;
    Counter() {
        count++;
    }
}

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
new Counter();
new Counter();
System.out.println(Counter.count);
}
}`}
  defaultCode={``}
/>

<div className="mt-8" />

## Key Takeaways

*   **Class Level**: Belongs to the class, not individual objects.
*   **Shared**: All objects share the SAME static variable.
*   **Utility**: Static methods are great for helper functions (like `Math.sqrt()`).

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Static vs Instance**: You CANNOT access non-static (instance) variables from a static method. The static method doesn't know _which_ object's variable to use!

> [!WARNING]
> **Memory**: Static variables stay in memory for the entire life of the program. Use them wisely.
