In this tutorial, we will learn about Java variables and literals with the help of examples.

## Java Variables

A variable is a location in memory (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).

### Create Variables in Java

Here's how we create a variable in Java,

```java
int speedLimit = 80;

```

Here, `speedLimit` is a variable of `int` data type, and we have assigned the value **80** to it.

The `int` data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers.
To learn more, visit [Java data types](/docs/variables-primitive-data-types).

In the example, we assigned a value to the variable during declaration. However, this is not mandatory.

You can declare variables and assign values separately. For example,

```java
int speedLimit;
speedLimit = 80;
```

**Note :** Java is a statically-typed language. It means that all variables
must be declared before they can be used.

</Callout>

### Change values of variables

The value of a variable can be changed in the program, hence the name 'variable'. For example,

```java
int speedLimit = 80;
... .. ...
speedLimit = 90;
```

Here, initially, the value of `speedLimit` is **80**. Later, we changed it to **90**.

However, we cannot change the data type of a variable in Java within the same scope.

What is variable scope?

Don't worry about it for now. Just remember that we can't do something like this:

```java
int speedLimit = 80;
... .. ...
float speedLimit;
```

### Rules for Naming Variables in Java

The Java programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for naming variables. Here's what you need to know:

- Java is case sensitive. Hence, `age` and `AGE` are two different variables. For example,

```java
int age = 24;
int AGE = 25;

System.out.println(age); // prints 24
System.out.println(AGE); // prints 25
```

- Variables must start with either a **letter**, an **underscore** (`_`), or a **dollar** (`$`) sign. For example,

```java
int age; // valid name and good practice
int _age; // valid but bad practice
int $age; // valid but bad practice
```

- Variable names cannot start with numbers. For example,

```java
int 1age; // invalid variables
```

- Variable names can't use whitespace. For example,

```java
int my age; // invalid variables
```

Here, if we need to use variable names having more than one word, use all lowercase letters for the first word and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. For example, `myAge`.

- When creating variables, choose a name that makes sense. For example, `score`, `number`, `level` make more sense than variable names such as `s`, `n`, and `l`.
- If you choose one-word variable names, use all lowercase letters. For example, it's better to use `speed` rather than `SPEED` or `sPEED`.

<Callout>

**Tip 💡:** Java developers love **camelCase**! Start with lowercase, then capitalize each new word: `mySuperCoolVariable`.

</Callout>

There are 4 types of variables in the Java programming language:

- **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)**
- **Class Variables (Static Fields)**
- **Local Variables**
- **Parameters**

    "Instance Variable",
    "Local Variable",
    "Class Variable (Static)",
    "Parameter",

## Java Literals

Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For example,

```java
int a = 1;
float b = 2.5;
char c = 'F';
```

Here, `1`, `2.5`, and `'F'` are literals.

Here are different types of literals in Java:

---

### 1. Boolean Literals

In Java, boolean literals are used to initialize boolean data types. They can store two values: `true` and `false`. For example,

```java
boolean flag1 = false;
boolean flag2 = true;
```

Here, `false` and `true` are two boolean literals.

---

### 2. Integer Literals

An integer literal is a numeric value (associated with numbers) without any fractional or exponential part. There are 4 types of integer literals in Java:

1. binary (base 2)
2. decimal (base 10)
3. octal (base 8)
4. hexadecimal (base 16)

For example:

```java
// binary
int binaryNumber = 0b10010;
// octal
int octalNumber = 027;

// decimal
int decNumber = 34;

// hexadecimal
int hexNumber = 0x2F; // 0x represents hexadecimal
// binary
int binNumber = 0b10010; // 0b represents binary

```

In Java, binary starts with **0b**, octal starts with **0**, and hexadecimal starts with **0x**.

**Note :** Integer literals are used to initialize variables of integer types
like `byte` , `short` , `int` , and `long` .

</Callout>

### 3. Floating-point Literals

A floating-point literal is a numeric literal that has either a fractional form or an exponential form. For example,

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 3.4;
    float myFloat = 3.4F;

    // 3.445*10^2
    double myDoubleScientific = 3.445e2;

    System.out.println(myDouble); // prints 3.4
    System.out.println(myFloat); // prints 3.4
    System.out.println(myDoubleScientific); // prints 344.5
  }
}
```

<p className="mt-4" />

<Callout>

**Note :** The floating-point literals are used to initialize `float` and `double`
type variables.

</Callout>

---

### 4. Character Literals

Character literals are Unicode characters enclosed inside single quotes. For example,

```java
char letter = 'a';
```

Here, `'a'` is the character literal.

We can also use escape sequences as character literals. For example, **\b** (backspace), **\t** (tab), **\n** (new line), etc.

---

### 5. String Literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed inside double quotes. For example,

```java
String str1 = "Java Programming";
String str2 = "Javapedia";
```

Here, `"Java Programming"` and `"Javapedia"` are two string literals.

## Key Takeaways

- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
- **Naming Rules**: Must start with a letter, `$`, or `_`. Cannot contain spaces.
- **Literals**: Fixed values directly used in code (e.g., `10`, `"Hello"`, `true`).

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Case Sensitivity**: `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are different variables.
>
> **Initialization**: Local variables must be initialized before use, or you'll get a compile-time error.
