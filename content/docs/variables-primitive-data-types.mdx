As the name suggests, data types specify the type of data that can be stored inside [variables in Java](/docs/variables-and-literals).

Java is a **statically-typed language**. This means that all variables must be declared before they can be used.

```java
int speed;
```

Here, `speed` is a variable, and the data type of the variable is `int`. The `int` data type determines that the `speed` variable can only contain integers.

There are 8 data types predefined in the Java programming language, known as **primitive data types**.

## Summary of Primitive Data Types

| Type | Size | Default Value | Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `byte` | 1 byte | 0 | -128 to 127 | Saves memory in large arrays |
| `short` | 2 bytes | 0 | -32,768 to 32,767 | Also saves memory |
| `int` | 4 bytes | 0 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | Default for whole numbers |
| `long` | 8 bytes | 0L | -2^63 to 2^63-1 | For very large numbers |
| `float` | 4 bytes | 0.0f | Unlimited | Single precision floating point |
| `double` | 8 bytes | 0.0d | Unlimited | Double precision floating point |
| `boolean` | 1 bit | false | true or false | For flags and logic |
| `char` | 2 bytes | '\u0000' | 0 to 65,535 | Single Unicode character |

## 1. Boolean Type

The `boolean` data type has two possible values: `true` or `false`. They are usually used for **true/false** conditions.

```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun); // Outputs true
System.out.println(isFishTasty); // Outputs false
```

---

## 2. Byte Type

The `byte` data type can have values from **-128** to **127** (8-bit signed two's complement integer). It is used to save memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters.

```java
byte myByte = 100;
System.out.println(myByte);
```

---

## 3. Short Type

The `short` data type can have values from **-32768** to **32767** (16-bit signed two's complement integer).

```java
short myShort = 5000;
System.out.println(myShort);
```

---

## 4. Int Type

The `int` data type is the default data type for integral values unless there is a problem with memory.

```java
int myInt = 100000;
System.out.println(myInt);
```

## 5. Long Type

The `long` data type is used when you need a range of values wider than those provided by `int`.

**Note**: You must end the value with an "L".

```java
long myLong = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myLong);
```

---

## 6. Float Type

The `float` data type is a single-precision 32-bit floating-point. It should never be used for precise values such as currency.

**Note**: You must end the value with an "f".

```java
float myFloat = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myFloat);
```

---

## 7. Double Type

The `double` data type is a double-precision 64-bit floating-point. It is the default type for decimal numbers.

```java
double myDouble = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myDouble);
```

---

## 8. Char Type

The `char` data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'.

```java
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);
```

Alternatively, you can use ASCII values to display certain characters:

```java
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1); // A
System.out.println(myVar2); // B
System.out.println(myVar3); // C
```

## Key Takeaways

*   **8 Primitives**: `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`.
*   **Default Types**: `int` is the default for whole numbers, `double` for decimals.
*   **Suffixes**: Use `L` for `long` (e.g., `100L`) and `F` for `float` (e.g., `3.14F`).

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Integer Division**: Dividing two integers results in an integer (e.g., `5 / 2 = 2`). Use `5.0 / 2` to get `2.5`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Overflow**: Storing a value larger than a type can handle (like putting 130 in a `byte`) causes overflow and unexpected negative numbers.
