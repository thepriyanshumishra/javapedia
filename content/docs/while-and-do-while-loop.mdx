In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop.

In the previous tutorial, you learned about [Java for loop](./for-loop). Here, you are going to learn about `while` and `do...while` loops.

---

## 1. Java while loop

Java while loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met. The syntax of the while loop is:

```java
while (condition) {
  // body of loop
}
```

Here,

1.  A `while` loop evaluates the **condition** inside the parenthesis `()`.
2.  If the **condition** evaluates to `true`, the code inside the `while` loop is executed.
3.  The **condition** is evaluated again.
4.  This process continues until the **condition** is `false`.
5.  When the **condition** evaluates to `false`, the loop stops.

### Example 1: Display Numbers from 1 to 5

```java
// Program to display numbers from 1 to 5
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 1, n = 5;

    // while loop from 1 to 5
    while(i <= n) {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
    }
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
2
3
4
5
```

## 2. Java do...while loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to while loop. However, the body of `do...while` loop is executed once before the test expression is checked.

```java
do {
    // body of loop
} while(condition);
```

### Example 2: Input Validation

The `do...while` loop is perfect for asking user input until they give a valid response.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;

        do {
            System.out.println("Enter a positive number: ");
            number = input.nextInt();
        } while (number <= 0);

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
    }
}
```

Here, the loop will keep asking for a number **at least once**, and repeat if the user enters a negative number or zero.

## 3. Infinite Loops

If **the condition** of a loop is always `true`, the loop runs for infinite times.

```java
// infinite while loop
while(true){
    // body of loop
}
```

---

## Key Takeaways

*   **While**: Checks condition _before_ running. Might not run at all.
*   **Do-While**: Checks condition _after_ running. Always runs at least once.
*   **Use Case**: Best when you don't know the number of iterations (e.g., reading user input until they type "exit").

## Common Pitfalls

> [!WARNING]
> **Infinite Loops**: It's very easy to forget to update your counter (e.g., `i++`) inside a while loop, causing it to run forever.

> [!WARNING]
> **Semicolon**: The `do...while` loop MUST end with a semicolon `;` after the condition. `do { } while(condition);`
