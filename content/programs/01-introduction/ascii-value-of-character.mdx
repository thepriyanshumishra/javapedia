title: Java Program to Find ASCII Value of a Character
description: A Java program to find and print the ASCII value of a character.

## Problem Description

Write a Java program that takes a character as input (or uses a hardcoded character) and prints its ASCII value.

## Code

```java title="AsciiValue.java"
public class AsciiValue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char ch = 'a';
        int ascii = ch;
        // You can also cast char to int
        int castAscii = (int) ch;

        System.out.println("The ASCII value of " + ch + " is: " + ascii);
        System.out.println("The ASCII value of " + ch + " is: " + castAscii);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
The ASCII value of a is: 97
The ASCII value of a is: 97
```

## Explanation

1.  **`char ch = 'a';`**: Declares a character variable `ch` and assigns it the value 'a'.
2.  **`int ascii = ch;`**: Assigns the character value to an integer variable. Java automatically promotes `char` to `int`, which results in the ASCII value.
3.  **`(int) ch`**: Explicitly casts the character to an integer, which also yields the ASCII value.
