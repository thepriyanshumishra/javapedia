## Problem Description

Write a Java program to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Code

```java title="ArithmeticOperators.java"
public class ArithmeticOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;

        System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
a + b = 15
a - b = 5
a * b = 50
a / b = 2
a % b = 0
```

## Explanation

1.  **`+` (Addition)**: Adds two operands.
2.  **`-` (Subtraction)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
3.  **`*` (Multiplication)**: Multiplies two operands.
4.  **`/` (Division)**: Divides the numerator by the denominator.
5.  **`%` (Modulus)**: Returns the remainder of the division.
