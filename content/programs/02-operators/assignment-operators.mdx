## Problem Description

Write a Java program to demonstrate the usage of assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).

## Code

```java title="AssignmentOperators.java"
public class AssignmentOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        int c = 0;

        c = a + b;
        System.out.println("c = a + b = " + c);

        c += a; // c = c + a
        System.out.println("c += a = " + c);

        c -= a; // c = c - a
        System.out.println("c -= a = " + c);

        c *= a; // c = c * a
        System.out.println("c *= a = " + c);

        a = 10;
        c = 15;
        c /= a; // c = c / a
        System.out.println("c /= a = " + c);

        a = 10;
        c = 15;
        c %= a; // c = c % a
        System.out.println("c %= a = " + c);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
c = a + b = 30
c += a = 40
c -= a = 30
c *= a = 300
c /= a = 1
c %= a = 5
```

## Explanation

1.  **`=`**: Simple assignment.
2.  **`+=`**: Add and assign.
3.  **`-=`**: Subtract and assign.
4.  **`*=`**: Multiply and assign.
5.  **`/=`**: Divide and assign.
6.  **`%=`**: Modulus and assign.

## Try Yourself

1.  **Compound Loop**: Use `+=` inside a loop to sum numbers from 1 to 10.
2.  **Implicit Casting**: Try `byte b = 10; b += 5;`. Does it work? Now try `b = b + 5;`. Why does one work and the other fail?
3.  **String Append**: Use `+=` with a String variable to build a sentence word by word.
4.  **Order of Operations**: If `a = 5`, what is `a *= 2 + 3`? Is it `(5 * 2) + 3` or `5 * (2 + 3)`?
5.  **Brain Twister**: Can you use `^=` to swap two integers without a temporary variable? (Recall the XOR swap).
