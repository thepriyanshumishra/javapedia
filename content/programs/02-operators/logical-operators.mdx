## Problem Description

Write a Java program to demonstrate the usage of logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

## Code

```java title="LogicalOperators.java"
public class LogicalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean a = true;
        boolean b = false;

        System.out.println("a && b: " + (a && b));
        System.out.println("a || b: " + (a || b));
        System.out.println("!a: " + (!a));
        System.out.println("!b: " + (!b));
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
a && b: false
a || b: true
!a: false
!b: true
```

## Explanation

1.  **`&&` (Logical AND)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
2.  **`||` (Logical OR)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
3.  **`!` (Logical NOT)**: Reverses the boolean value of the operand.

## Try Yourself

1.  **Combine Operators**: Evaluate `(5 > 3) && (8 > 5)`. Is it true or false?
2.  **Short Circuit**: In `false && (5 / 0 == 0)`, does the division by zero cause an error? Why or why not?
3.  **De Morgan's Laws**: Is `!(A && B)` the same as `!A || !B`? Write a code to verify.
4.  **Three Conditions**: Check if a number `n` is between 10 and 20 (inclusive).
    *Hint: `n >= 10 && n <= 20`*
5.  **Brain Twister**: What is the result of `true || false && false`? (Check operator precedence).
