## Problem Description

Write a Java program to compare two numbers using relational operators.

## Code

```java title="RelationalOperators.java"
public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;

        System.out.println("a == b: " + (a == b));
        System.out.println("a != b: " + (a != b));
        System.out.println("a > b: " + (a > b));
        System.out.println("a < b: " + (a < b));
        System.out.println("a >= b: " + (a >= b));
        System.out.println("a <= b: " + (a <= b));
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
a == b: false
a != b: true
a > b: false
a < b: true
a >= b: false
a <= b: true
```

## Explanation

1.  **`==` (Equal to)**: Checks if values are equal.
2.  **`!=` (Not equal to)**: Checks if values are not equal.
3.  **`>` (Greater than)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.
4.  **`<` (Less than)**: Checks if the left operand is less than the right.
5.  **`>=` (Greater than or equal to)**: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
6.  **`<=` (Less than or equal to)**: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

## Try Yourself

1.  **Compare Characters**: Compare 'a' and 'b'. Is `'a' < 'b'` true? Why?
2.  **Floating Point**: Compare `10.0` and `10`. Are they equal?
3.  **Negative Numbers**: Is `-5 > -10` true or false?
4.  **Equality Check**: Be careful with `==` vs `=`. Try `if (a = 10)` and see the error.
5.  **Brain Twister**: Why is `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` false in Java? (Hint: Floating point precision).
