shortTitle: Check Even or Odd
description: Learn to check if a number is even or odd in Java using modulus operator. Complete program with examples and explanations of different approaches.
---

## Problem Description

Write a Java program to check whether a given number is **Even** or **Odd**.

-   **Even Number**: A number perfectly divisible by 2 (remainder is 0). Examples: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
-   **Odd Number**: A number not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1). Examples: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

## Code

```java title="CheckEvenOdd.java"
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CheckEvenOdd {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num;
        System.out.print("Enter an Integer number: ");

        // The input provided by user is stored in num
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        num = input.nextInt();

        /* If number is divisible by 2 then it's an even number
         * else odd number */
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(num + " is an even number");
        } else {
            System.out.println(num + " is an odd number");
        }
        
        input.close();
    }
}
```

## Output

**Case 1:**

```plaintext
Enter an Integer number: 78
78 is an even number
```

**Case 2:**

```plaintext
Enter an Integer number: 77
77 is an odd number
```

## Explanation

1.  **`Scanner`**: Used to take input from the user.
2.  **`%` (Modulus Operator)**: This operator returns the remainder of a division.
    -   `num % 2` divides `num` by 2.
    -   If the remainder is `0`, the number is even.
    -   If the remainder is `1` (or -1 for negative odd numbers), the number is odd.
3.  **`if-else`**: Checks the condition. If true, prints "Even"; otherwise, prints "Odd".

## Try Yourself

1.  **Zero Check**: Run the program with `0`. Is it even or odd?
2.  **Negative Numbers**: Try `-4` and `-5`. Does the logic hold?
3.  **Ternary Operator**: Can you rewrite the `if-else` block using a single line?
    `String result = (num % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";`
4.  **Bitwise Challenge**: Try checking for odd/even using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).
    *Hint: `(num & 1) == 0` means even.*
5.  **Looping**: Modify the program to check numbers from 1 to 10 automatically.
