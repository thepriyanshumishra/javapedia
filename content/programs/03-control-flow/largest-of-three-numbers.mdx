## Problem Description

Write a Java program to find the largest number among three given numbers.

## Code

```java title="LargestNumber.java"
public class LargestNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double n1 = -4.5, n2 = 3.9, n3 = 2.5;

        if( n1 >= n2 && n1 >= n3)
            System.out.println(n1 + " is the largest number.");

        else if (n2 >= n1 && n2 >= n3)
            System.out.println(n2 + " is the largest number.");

        else
            System.out.println(n3 + " is the largest number.");
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
3.9 is the largest number.
```

## Explanation

1.  **`if-else if-else` Ladder**: Checks conditions sequentially.
2.  **`n1 >= n2 && n1 >= n3`**: Checks if `n1` is greater than or equal to both `n2` and `n3`.
3.  **`n2 >= n1 && n2 >= n3`**: Checks if `n2` is greater than or equal to both `n1` and `n3`.
4.  If neither is true, `n3` must be the largest.
