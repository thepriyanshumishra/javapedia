description: A Java program to calculate the average of numbers using an array.

## Problem Description

Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements.

## Code

```java title="AverageArray.java"
public class AverageArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] numArray = { 45.3, 67.5, -45.6, 20.34, 33.0, 45.6 };
        double sum = 0.0;

        for (double num : numArray) {
            sum += num;
        }

        double average = sum / numArray.length;
        System.out.format("The average is: %.2f", average);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
The average is: 27.69
```

## Explanation

1.  **Enhanced For Loop**: Iterates through each element of the array.
2.  **Sum**: Accumulates the sum of all elements.
3.  **Average**: Divides the sum by the number of elements (`numArray.length`).
