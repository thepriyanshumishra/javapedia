## Problem Description

Write a Java program to find the frequency of a specific character in a given string.

## Code

```java title="Frequency.java"
public class Frequency {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "This website is awesome.";
        char ch = 'e';
        int frequency = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if(ch == str.charAt(i)) {
                ++frequency;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Frequency of " + ch + " = " + frequency);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Frequency of e = 4
```

## Explanation

1.  **Loop**: Iterate through each character of the string.
2.  **Comparison**: Check if the current character matches the target character.
3.  **Counter**: Increment if there's a match.
