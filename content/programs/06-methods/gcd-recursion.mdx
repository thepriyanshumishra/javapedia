## Problem Description

Write a Java program to find the GCD (HCF) of two numbers using recursion.

## Code

```java title="GCDRecursion.java"
public class GCDRecursion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 366, n2 = 60;
        int hcf = hcf(n1, n2);

        System.out.printf("G.C.D of %d and %d is %d.", n1, n2, hcf);
    }

    public static int hcf(int n1, int n2) {
        if (n2 != 0)
            return hcf(n2, n1 % n2);
        else
            return n1;
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
G.C.D of 366 and 60 is 6.
```

## Explanation

1.  **Euclidean Algorithm**: Efficient method for computing GCD.
2.  **Recursion**: `hcf(n2, n1 % n2)` until `n2` becomes 0.
