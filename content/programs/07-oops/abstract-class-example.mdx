description: A Java program to demonstrate the usage of abstract classes and methods.

## Problem Description

Write a Java program to demonstrate the concept of abstract classes and abstract methods.

## Code

```java title="AbstractClass.java"
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("I can eat.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark bark");
    }
}

public class AbstractClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d1 = new Dog();
        d1.makeSound();
        d1.eat();
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Bark bark
I can eat.
```

## Explanation

1.  **`abstract` Class**: Cannot be instantiated. Can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
2.  **`abstract` Method**: Has no body. Must be implemented by the subclass.
