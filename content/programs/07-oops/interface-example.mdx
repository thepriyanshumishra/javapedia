## Problem Description

Write a Java program to demonstrate the concept of interfaces.

## Code

```java title="InterfaceExample.java"
interface Polygon {
    void getArea(int length, int breadth);
}

class Rectangle implements Polygon {
    public void getArea(int length, int breadth) {
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + (length * breadth));
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle();
        r1.getArea(5, 6);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
The area of the rectangle is 30
```

## Explanation

1.  **Interface**: A completely abstract class. All methods are public and abstract by default.
2.  **`implements`**: Used by a class to inherit from an interface.
3.  **Multiple Inheritance**: Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
