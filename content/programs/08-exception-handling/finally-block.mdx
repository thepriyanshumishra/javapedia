## Problem Description

Write a Java program to demonstrate the usage of the `finally` block in exception handling.

## Code

```java title="FinallyBlock.java"
public class FinallyBlock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int data = 25 / 5;
            System.out.println(data);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        } finally {
            System.out.println("finally block is always executed");
        }
        System.out.println("rest of the code...");
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
5
finally block is always executed
rest of the code...
```

## Explanation

1.  **`finally` Block**: Executed regardless of whether an exception is handled or not.
2.  **Usage**: Used to close resources like files or database connections.
