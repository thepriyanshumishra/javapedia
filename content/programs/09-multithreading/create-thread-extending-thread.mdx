## Problem Description

Write a Java program to create a thread by extending the `Thread` class.

## Code

```java title="ExtendThread.java"
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class ExtendThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Thread is running...
```

## Explanation

1.  **`extends Thread`**: Inherit from the Thread class.
2.  **`run()`**: Override the run method to define the thread's action.
3.  **`start()`**: Call start method to begin execution of the thread.
