## Problem Description

Write a Java program to create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

## Code

```java title="ImplementRunnable.java"
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class ImplementRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable m1 = new MyRunnable();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(m1);
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Thread is running...
```

## Explanation

1.  **`implements Runnable`**: Implement the Runnable interface.
2.  **`Thread` Constructor**: Pass the Runnable instance to the Thread constructor.
3.  **Flexibility**: Preferred over extending Thread class as it allows extending another class.
