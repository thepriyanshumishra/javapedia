## Problem Description

Write a Java program to write text to a file.

## Code

```java title="WriteToFile.java"
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
            myWriter.write("Files in Java might be tricky, but it is fun enough!");
            myWriter.close();
            System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Successfully wrote to the file.
```

## Explanation

1.  **`FileWriter`**: Used to write character-oriented data to a file.
2.  **`write()`**: Writes the string to the file.
3.  **`close()`**: Closes the file writer.
