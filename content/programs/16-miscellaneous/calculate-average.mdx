## Problem Description

Write a Java program to calculate the average of numbers using an array.

## Code

```java title="AverageUsingArray.java"
public class AverageUsingArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] numArray = { 45.3, 67.5, -45.6, 20.34, 33.0, 45.6 };
        double sum = 0.0;

        for (double num : numArray) {
            sum += num;
        }

        double average = sum / numArray.length;
        System.out.format("The average is: %.2f", average);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
The average is: 27.69
```

## Explanation

1.  **Sum**: Iterate through the array and calculate the sum.
2.  **Average**: Divide sum by the length of the array.
