## Problem Description

Write a Java program to calculate Compound Interest.

## Code

```java title="CompoundInterest.java"
public class CompoundInterest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double principal = 2000, rate = 8, time = 5, number = 12;
        double interest = principal * (Math.pow((1 + rate / 100), (time * number))) - principal;
        
        System.out.println("Principal: " + principal);
        System.out.println("Interest Rate: " + rate);
        System.out.println("Time Duration: " + time);
        System.out.println("Number of Time interest Compounded: " + number);
        System.out.println("Compound Interest: " + interest);
    }
}
```

## Output

```bash
Principal: 2000.0
Interest Rate: 8.0
Time Duration: 5.0
Number of Time interest Compounded: 12.0
Compound Interest: 202126.95
```

## Explanation

1.  **Formula**: `P * (1 + R/100)^(t*n) - P`.
